# How to contribute

This repository includes **samples**, **documentation** and **supporting scripts** for the SDK. The core source code for the SDK is not part of this repository. The binary is available via a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Maps.Unity). The supporting scripts are also published as part of this NuGet package.

Contributions to the samples, documentation, and supporting scripts in this repository are welcome. Changes to the supporting scripts will be folded back into the NuGet package.

Please refer to the following sections on what is expected of feature requests, bug reports, and code contributions.

## Submitting feature requests
For feature requests and suggestions, please log a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Unity/issues). 

When creating a feature request or suggestion, please provide a clear desciption and any Unity version requirements or other relevant dependicies.

## Filing bugs
For non-security related bugs please log a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/MapsSDK-Unity/issues). 

When submitting a bug, please be sure to include a clear and concise description of the issue, Unity version, steps to repoduce, and any other relevant information like stack traces or screenshots.

## Reporting security issues

## Contributing code and content


### Identifying the scale

If you would like to contribute a small bug fix to the supporting scripts, a documentation improvement, or contribution to the sample projects, feel free to start working on the change and to submit a pull request at any time.

If you would like to contribute a significant bug fix or new feature to the supporting scripts, please discuss the change with the team by starting a discussion on the issues page.
Pull requests are welcome and encouraged for the supporting scripts, but these changes must meet a high bar since the scripts are distributed as part of the NuGet package.

### Submitting a pull request

Once a change is ready, submit a pull request to the master branch. 

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

### Feedback

Your pull request will go through review by the team. We will attempt to review changes as soon as possible. 

### Publishing

For changes to the supporting scripts, once a pull request has been approved and merged to master, we will schedule it for release in the next NuGet package update. We will provide an ETA on the NuGet package release.

Changes to documentation and samples don't need to be published to a NuGet package, so once a pull request is complete, the changes will be immediately reflected in the master branch.
